# A mathematical model of a small virus infection over discrete and continuous time models

## Background 
 Using the three component dynamical systems model from the paper "A Quasi-Steady-State Approximation to the Basic Target-Cell-Limited Viral Dynamics Model‚Äù, I modified the equations and recreated discrete and continuous time models of a virus infection.
