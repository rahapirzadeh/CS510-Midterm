# A mathematical model of a small virus infection over discrete and continuous time models

## Background 
 Using the three component dynamical systems model from the paper "A Quasi-Steady-State Approximation to the Basic Target-Cell-Limited Viral Dynamics Model‚Äù, researchers derived an analytic solution for the model, providing time evolution values of all three compartments of uninfected cells, infected cells and virus.
